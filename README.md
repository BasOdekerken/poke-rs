# poke-rs

A small rust hobby project for making pokémon-like fan games.
This is purely a learning project but who knows, maybe it will be useful to someone.

This is **not affiliated with Nintendo, Game Freak or the Pokémon Company**.

The long term vision is to provide building blocks for making fan games. I do also plan to make some tooling that will make it easier to create these games.

## Status
